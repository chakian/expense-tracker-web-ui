  min_instances: 0 #Specify a value from 0 to 1000. You can set the parameter to the value 0 to allow scaling to 0 instances to lower costs when no requests are being served

  # Used with target_throughput_utilization to specify when a new instance is started due to concurrent requests.
  # When the number of concurrent requests reaches a value equal to max_concurrent_requests times target_throughput_utilization, the scheduler tries to start a new instance.
